## Abstract
This paper investigates the capability of large language models (LLMs) to autonomously update API documentation. 
Given that API documentation often becomes outdated and maintaining it manually is resource-intensive, 
the authors propose a method leveraging LLMs to identify inconsistencies, outdated endpoints, 
and missing details in API docs, and then generate revisions or additions. The approach incorporates: 
(1) comparing issue reports, code changes, and existing documentation to detect gaps, 
(2) prompting the LLM with structured context to produce candidate documentation updates, and 
(3) validating the generated content through automated checks and human oversight. 
Experimental evaluation across real-world software projects shows that the method improved documentation accuracy and reduced maintenance effort compared to manual updates.
The results suggest that LLM-based documentation updating can enhance documentation quality and efficiency in software development workflows.
